HyosPy
======

HyosPy (Hydrodynamic and oil spill Python) is a model coupling system that automates multiple simulations of a hydrodynamic model (SELFE) using real-time downloaded hindcast/foreast data, then couples the results to an oil spill transport model (PyGNOME or RK4) and provides visualization/animation in the 2D Google Map and 3D Google Earth GIS.
